My pet project on the Magento2. 
The main extension (Tsum_CashFlow) allows an accounting of home cash flow. 

1.0.0 version:
- added cf_item entity
- product uses as storage item (with a separated attribute set)
- Order used as outcome movements (added cf-items to quote_item)
- added income document
- added the registry and storage_agg tables
